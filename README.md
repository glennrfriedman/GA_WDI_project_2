## Name: TV Time 

## User Stories: 

**Avid Consumer:**
As an avid consumer of television I want to be able to access a resource that will show me the air date and time of my favorite shows so that I can better manage my schedule and make sure I never miss an episode! 

**Casual Consumer:**
As a casual TV viewer I want a resource that will allow me to quickly view information about shows I have seen in the past with relevant data about when that show is on and other useful information about the show. There are just too many shows today for me to keep track of! 

**Forgetful Consumer:**
As a forgetful TV consumer I want to be able to add and edit notes about my favorite shows so I can remember things about them like the plot is, whether or not I like the show, and which characters are doing what!

## API:
Link: http://www.tvmaze.com/api

This is the TVMaze API. It is really cool and returns data in a JSON that contains information about the airdate/times, images, cast, IMDB rating, number of episodes, etc for thousands of shows. 

## NPM: 
Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/countdown

This is a really cool NPM that will allow me to show the amount of time between the current date/time and the date/time a show will air. 

## Challenges: 
This project will have many challenges but the largest ones I foresee will be: 
- Getting user authorization to work correctly given limited experience
- Project management - ensuring goals are met on-time
- Storing data from the API in a database so that users see all their saved shows when the login
- Implement a search bar that returns all the results based on keyword

## Technology: 
- JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, node.js, Heroku, NPM modules (express, mustache-express, pg-promise, body-parser, countdown, nodemon, morgan, passport, passport-local, cookie-parser, dotenv, axios, bcrypt, express-session)
